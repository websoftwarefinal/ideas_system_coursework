## Description

This project is developed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. It aims to provide a structured and organized approach to building PHP web applications.

## Directory Structure

- `resources/views`: This directory contains all the view files for the application. Views are responsible for presenting the user interface to the users.

- `Models`: This directory holds all the model files for the application. Models represent the application's data and business logic.
